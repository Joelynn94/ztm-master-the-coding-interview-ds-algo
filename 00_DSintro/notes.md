## What is a data structure?

- A way for us to organize data.

- A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Why so many of them?

Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

### 2 parts to understanding data structures

- How to build a data structure (with code)
- How to use a data structure (when to use one over another)

## Operations on data structures

- Access (how to access data)
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal (access each data item once, so it can be processed)
- Searching (location of a data item in a collection)
- Sorting

## What a computer needs to run code

CPU, RAM, Storage (permanant)

- (CPU) When a variable is declared in a script, it's going to get held in (RAM)
- (Storage) persistant storage

- RAM have "shelves" that have an address. Each shelf has 1 byte of information. Each address has 8 bits (a 1 or 0). 8 bits are equal to 1 byte.
- Computer gets a speed boost when reading addresses that are closer to each other.
- The CPU has access to all of these addresses (connections)
- The CPU has a tiny bit of storage (cache)

## What is good code?

- Readable
- Scalable (Big O)
  ** How long an algorithm takes to run. When the input grows, how much does the algorithm slow down.
  ** How much memory a computer has

## The Runtime

- How long it takes to run a certain problem through a function or a task

## 3 Pillars of code

- Write readable, clean code that is maintainable
- Has a good time complexity (speed)
- What's the space complexity (memory) usage of code
